 In order to identify whether the data in the victim segment are valid or not,
 F2FS manages a bitmap. Each bit represents the validity of a block, and the
 bitmap is composed of a bit stream covering whole blocks in main area.

-Fallocate(2) Policy
--------------------
-
-The default policy follows the below posix rule.
-
-Allocating disk space
-    The default operation (i.e., mode is zero) of fallocate() allocates
-    the disk space within the range specified by offset and len.  The
-    file size (as reported by stat(2)) will be changed if offset+len is
-    greater than the file size.  Any subregion within the range specified
-    by offset and len that did not contain data before the call will be
-    initialized to zero.  This default behavior closely resembles the
-    behavior of the posix_fallocate(3) library function, and is intended
-    as a method of optimally implementing that function.
-
-However, once F2FS receives ioctl(fd, F2FS_IOC_SET_PIN_FILE) in prior to
-fallocate(fd, DEFAULT_MODE), it allocates on-disk blocks addressess having
-zero or random data, which is useful to the below scenario where:
- 1. create(fd)
- 2. ioctl(fd, F2FS_IOC_SET_PIN_FILE)
- 3. fallocate(fd, 0, 0, size)
- 4. address = fibmap(fd, offset)
- 5. open(blkdev)
- 6. write(blkdev, address)
